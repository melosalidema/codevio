# Codevio — Core Services & Service Packages

Working doc for the two ClickUp tasks: **Define core services** and **Define service packages**.

Companion to `agency-strategy.md`. That doc sets mission, market, ICP, and positioning; this one defines *what we sell* (core services) and *how it is packaged* (service packages). Section 6 of the strategy doc summarizes the packages — this file is the source of truth.

Decisions locked in:

- Core services are described by **discipline** (strategy, design, engineering, iteration).
- Packages bundle disciplines into **fixed-scope, fixed-timeline outcomes**.
- Package menu is four: **Landing Page Sprint** (entry), **Website Sprint**, **MVP Sprint**, **Launch Retainer**.
- Prices are permanent list prices, published on the site. List: Landing Page Sprint €500 · Website Sprint €750 · MVP Sprint €1,000 · Launch Retainer €1,500–2,000/mo · scoping deep-dive €750 (credited on booking).
- Category vocabulary: **studio** (not "agency") everywhere.

- **Delivered by**: same team that shipped the sprint.
- **Feeds**: Launch Retainer (plus the 30-day support window in the full sprints and the 7-day window in the Landing Page Sprint).

### Retired / not core

Say no to these, or route them to a partner:

- Paid ads and performance marketing
- SEO content retainers and social media management
- Generic "digital marketing" packages
- Native mobile development
- Framer / Webflow-only builds — we ship real code, not no-code sites
- Print-heavy branding engagements
- Maintenance-only contracts and lowest-bidder work

Route declines to partners where possible (ads, SEO, mobile, no-code). Partner referrals earn a 10% referral fee.

## 2. Service packages

Four packages, all fixed scope and fixed timeline. Rules that apply to every package:

- **Scope locks at kickoff.** Deliverables, timeline, and ship date are agreed before we start.
- **Anything outside scope becomes the next sprint** — never an open-ended edit.
- **Two revision rounds per phase**, with feedback consolidated within two business days.
- **30 days of post-launch support** included in both full sprints (7 days in the Landing Page Sprint).
- **Prices are published on the site**; every engagement still gets a written quote via `/contact` confirming scope.
- **Payment terms**: Landing Page Sprint 100% upfront · Website and MVP sprints 50% at kickoff, 50% at ship · retainer monthly upfront.
- **Client lateness rule**: if inputs or feedback arrive later than the agreed window, the ship date shifts day-for-day.
- **Booking policy**: a deposit secures the sprint slot; we run a maximum of 1–2 sprints concurrently, first booked, first served.
- **Proof rights**: every package includes permission to publish the work and a testimonial request.
- **Ship-date guarantee**: if we miss the agreed ship date for reasons within our control, the client gets 10% back or a free retainer week.
- We only book work we can ship inside the package timeline. No exceptions.
- **Entry-offer credit**: the Landing Page Sprint fee (€500) is credited toward a Website Sprint or MVP Sprint booked within 30 days.
- **Scoping deep-dive**: complex MVPs can start with a paid deep-dive (€750), credited toward the sprint if booked within 30 days.
